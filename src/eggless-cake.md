## Common Issues and Solutions

When making the Orange Aromatic Cupcakes, several issues can arise that might affect the final outcome. Here are some potential problems and ways to prevent them:

### 1. Cracking of the Cupcakes

- Cause: Over-mixing the batter or an oven that’s too hot.
- Prevention: Mix the batter until just combined, and ensure your oven temperature is accurate with an oven thermometer.

### 2. Burning

- Cause: Leaving the cupcakes in the oven too long or the oven temperature being too high.
- Prevention: Always set a timer, watch the cupcakes closely near the end of baking time, and verify your oven temperature with a thermometer. If your oven has hot spots, rotate the tray halfway through baking.

### 3. Deflating

- Cause: Opening the oven door too early can cause a sudden change in temperature, leading to deflation.
- Prevention: Avoid opening the oven door until it’s time to check if the cupcakes are done, usually after the first 20 minutes of baking.

### 4. Uneven Rising

- Cause: Uneven distribution of leavening agents (baking powder/soda).
- Prevention: Sift the dry ingredients multiple times to ensure even distribution. Also, ensure your leavening agents are not expired.

### 5. Cupcakes Sticking to the Pan

- Cause: Insufficient greasing of the cupcake molds or liners.
- Prevention: Use good-quality liners or generously grease the molds with butter or a non-stick spray before pouring in the batter.

### 6. The Cupcakes Are Too Dry

- Cause: Overbaking is the most common reason for dry cupcakes.
- Prevention: Stick to the recommended baking time and check for doneness using a toothpick. If it comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs, the cupcakes are done.

### 7. Cupcakes Sinking in the Middle

- Cause: Underbaking or a sudden temperature change.
- Prevention: Ensure the cupcakes are fully baked before removing them from the oven and try not to open the oven door unnecessarily.

By being aware of these common issues and following the prevention tips, you can greatly increase your chances of making perfect Orange Aromatic Cupcakes. Happy baking!
