# Grape Wine Recipe

This grape wine recipe is a delightful venture into home winemaking, infused with aromatic spices for a unique flavor. To ensure a smooth winemaking experience, pay attention to the caveats and tips provided to avoid common issues.

## Ingredients

- 1 kilogram of grapes
- 750 grams of sugar
- 1 egg white
- A handful of whole or broken wheat (optional for body and flavor)
- 1 piece of cinnamon
- 4 to 5 cloves
- 4 to 5 cardamom pods
- 1 liter of boiled and cooled water
- 1 teaspoon of Potassium Sorbate (to stabilize wine)

## Equipment

- Fermentation jar
- Wooden spoon
- Strainer or cheesecloth
- Clean towel
- Sanitizer for equipment

## Instructions

1. Preparation of Grapes:

   - Wash grapes in salt water for 2 to 3 hours to ensure they are clean and pesticide-free.
   - Rinse them thoroughly with fresh water. Pat the grapes dry with a towel, being careful not to crush them.

2. Mashing and Mixing:

   - Mash the grapes well in a clean, dry fermentation jar. This step is crucial for extracting maximum flavor and initiating the fermentation process.
   - Add beaten egg white into the jar with the mashed grapes. The egg white will help clarify the wine by binding to solids, which can then be filtered out after fermentation.
   - Incorporate the sugar, whole or broken wheat (if using), cinnamon, cloves, and cardamom pods with the mashed grapes. These spices will impart a distinct aroma and flavor profile to your wine.

3. Adding Water and Beginning Fermentation:

   - Carefully pour boiled and cooled water into the jar until it is 3/4 full. Do not overfill as the mixture will expand during fermentation.
   - Stir the mixture daily with a wooden spoon at the same time for 21 days. Regular stirring is essential for preventing mold formation on the surface and ensuring an even fermentation.

4. Post-Fermentation Treatment:

   - After 21 days, filter the mixture to remove sediments and solids. It's normal for sediments to formâ€”these are byproducts of the fermentation process.
   - Add 1 teaspoon of Potassium Sorbate to stabilize the wine. This step is crucial to stop the fermentation process and prevent the growth of unwanted bacteria and yeast that could spoil the wine.

5. Final Filtration and Storage:
   - If you notice sediments after adding Potassium Sorbate, filter the wine again after 2-3 days to ensure clarity.
   - Store the wine in a cool, dark place. It is ready to drink but will improve with age.

## Caveats and Tips

- Sanitation: Ensure all equipment is thoroughly sanitized to avoid contamination.
- Egg White: Some may prefer to omit this due to dietary restrictions or concerns about raw egg usage; it primarily aids in clarification.
- Potassium Sorbate: This preservative is important for stabilizing wine but ensure it is added after fermentation has ceased to avoid affecting the taste.
- Fermentation Watch: If the jar shows signs of excessive bubbling or overflow, it may be too full or fermenting too rapidly. Consider transferring some mixture to another sanitized jar.

By following these steps and keeping an eye out for common pitfalls, you will be well on your way to creating a delightful homemade grape wine with aromatic touches that is sure to impress.
