## Ingredients

- 6 ripe tomatoes
- 6 cloves garlic, peeled
- 1 onion, finely diced
- Oregano, to taste
- Salt, to taste
- A handful of coriander leaves, finely chopped
- A few basil leaves for garnish

## Directions

1. Start by preparing the tomatoes: cut out the stem area and score an X on the bottom of each.
2. Boil water in a pot and submerge the tomatoes for a few minutes until the skins begin to wrinkle and peel away.
3. Quickly move the tomatoes from the boiling water to an ice bath to stop the cooking process. Once cooled, peel off the skins.
4. In a medium-sized saucepan, heat a splash of olive oil and gently fry the onions and garlic until translucent and aromatic.
5. Add the peeled tomatoes to the saucepan, mashing them lightly to break them down. Stir in the chopped coriander, season with salt and oregano, and let the mixture simmer.
6. For a smooth sauce, transfer the contents of the saucepan to a blender and pur√©e until the desired consistency is achieved.

## Pro Tips

- Exercise caution with the hot tomatoes to avoid burns.
- Tailor the seasoning with salt and oregano to suit your taste buds.
- For an ultra-smooth sauce, pass the pureed sauce through a fine sieve to eliminate seeds and any bits of skin.
- Enhance the sauce with a dash of red wine vinegar or lemon juice for a slight tang.
- Garnish the finished sauce with fresh basil leaves for an added burst of flavor.
